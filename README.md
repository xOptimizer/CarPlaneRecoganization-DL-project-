## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build an image recognition system capable of distinguishing between images of cars and planes. The system leverages the power of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in this classification task.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
 - Clone the repository
 - Download all the Python Libraries Required for Machine Learning ![](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-python-libraries-for-machine-learning/)

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation of the model is also included in this repository . However, you can also obtain a similar dataset from publicly available sources such as Kaggle, ImageNet, or other image repositories. Ensure that the dataset is organized into separate folders for cars and planes, with appropriate train  and test splits.

## Model Architecture
The image recognition model is based on a deep convolutional neural network. It comprises several convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The specific architecture can be found in the code.

## Training
To train the model on your dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset by organizing it into train  and test sets.

Configure the training settings such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs in the code.

Start the training process:

## Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model on the test dataset , 
The evaluation results, including accuracy and possibly other metrics, will be displayed.

## Usage
Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to make predictions on new images. 
The model will predict whether each image contains a car or a plane and display the results. 0 if it is Cars and 1 for the Planes

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues or want to enhance the project, feel free to open a pull request. Additionally, if you have any suggestions for improvements, please open an issue.

## Conclusion 
This is a small project made while learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning Which I am very excited to share among the Geeks and I would Like if 
you use it for good purpose .
